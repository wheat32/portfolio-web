        <h2><i class="bi bi-file-text me-3"></i>Overview</h2>
        <p class="section-lead">
            As a Technical Engagement Developer at DFIN, I worked at the intersection of client relations and technical development. 
            My role involved directly engaging with clients to solve their more technical issues, providing live demonstrations and 
            tutorials, while also developing internal applications for business and sales teams.
        </p>
        <p class="section-lead">
            A key aspect of my work was application security, including penetration remediation planning and other security 
            remediation plans. I ensured that products were delivered in a timely manner while maintaining the highest security standards.
        </p>
        <p class="section-lead">
            Prior to my full-time position, I completed two internships at DFIN (Summer 2017 and Summer 2018), where I worked as a 
            developer on the data room web application called <strong>Venue</strong>, focusing on troubleshooting server errors and defect fixing.
